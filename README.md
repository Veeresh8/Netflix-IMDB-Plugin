PlayStore Link - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.droid.netflixIMDB

YouTube often interrupts your viewing experience with ads.Using this app we'll skip ads for you (after the 5-0 countdown, without you doing anything). This app is not a ad-blocker, but an ad skipper.

Also, finding quality content is hard. Netflix, Hotstar, Prime Video have ditched the IMDB rating feature which leaves many users puzzled to decide what title to watch.

If IMDB rating is a deciding factor for you to watch any new titles, then this app is just for you.

How does the app work

The app relies on Accessibility Services to skip ads, provide you quick IMDB ratings of the title you are about to watch. 

We take Personal Privacy very seriously and do not listen to any Accessibility Events from other apps except Netflix, Hotstar, Prime Video, Youtube also no Personal Information is transmitted over the network

The app is ad-free and promotion-free
